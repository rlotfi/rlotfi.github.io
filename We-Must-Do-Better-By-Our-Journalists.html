								<p>I stare at the webpage trimmed in purple for the graduate program at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at New York University. As I scrolled down, words teeming with encouragement appeared on the page: “. . . responsive to the industry demand for journalists,” “94% of the Class of 2019 landed jobs, paid fellowships, internships, or freelance work after graduation.” I think about my parents who, when they immigrated here from revolution-torn countries, fought through sleepless nights and second and third jobs to rise the ranks of modest industries so they could help my brothers and I go to college and do the same. I think about a report published this month in The Wall Street Journal that exposed how “Journalism schools leave graduates with hefty student loans. . . even as opportunities diminish.” I think about how CareerCast’s 2019 Jobs Rated Report, with supplemental data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ranked “Newspaper reporter” as the third worst job in America, only surpassed by “Logging worker” and “Taxi driver.” I click out of the window. </p>
								<p>The connection between hate crimes against Black and Asian Amercians is a reality we must examine if we want to truly understand racism in this country. For decades, the rhetoric spewed by inculpable racists towards Black Americans was clear: we don’t like you not because of your race, but because you’re lazy, you’re rude, you’re loud, and the list excruciatingly goes on and on. And for many, especially to those newly indoctrinated, this sounded like a reasonable justification. On the other side, we had a race that supposedly acted oppositely: why can’t you be more like Asian Americans, who are hard-working, polite, and stay in their lane. And that, too, was accepted so effortlessly that it even got it’s own moniker: “model minority.” There’s no doubt that Asian and Black American’s face racism differently, and certainly to different degrees. But what happens now, when Asian American hate crimes have skyrocketed in the past year. What happens now that Asian Americans are coming forward with their stories of being mocked, diminished, and infantilized. It’s clear now that even America’s “model minority” cannot escape the violence and hatred of those who have never and will never think of another race as being equal to theirs.</p>
								<p>Trying to find a justification to racism is an act reserved only for those distasteful enough to continue lying to the world. The clear truth is that there is no rhyme or reason. It doesn’t matter if you’re poor or rich, rowdy or quite, educated or not. In the end, racism knows no principles besides to judge based on differences, and that unfortunate reality is one every minority understands.</p>
