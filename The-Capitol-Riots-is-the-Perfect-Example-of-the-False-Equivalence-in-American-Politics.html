								<p>During a press conference on January 8th, two days after the Capitol Riots, Joe Biden stood firm in his moderation when he declared, “We need a Republican Party. We need an opposition that is principled and strong.” It’s not that I disagree with this sentiment - having essentially a two-party system is certainly not the best, but having just one party seems worse - I simply disagree with the idea that the Republican party is our equal and opposite, our other side of the same coin. At some point since it’s inception the two-party system was probably more akin to the Jefferson-Adams style of frenemies-with-differing-but-equally-reasonable-viewpoints type of relationship, but after the riots on Capitol Hill, we must acknowledge the false equivalencies of the Democratic and Republican parties.</p>
								<p>There was a moment just a few months ago when this idea crystallized in my head. I was driving in my car when I first heard the news of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Gindburg’s death, and was suddenly aware of the massive effects this would have throughout our government. In the ensuing hours speculations of the future started flying wildly, but one question stood above all else: will the majority-Republican Senate push through with a nominee, despite it completely contradicting their rhetoric after Justice Scalia’s death only 4 years ago? Of course the answer was yes, but at the time, as these questions floated in my head still unanswered, I really could not fathom how one of the most powerful, legitimate political parties, consisting of highly educated and experienced lawmakers, in the land of freedom and democracy, would get away with such deceit. I realize now that I held my standards for political parties to a certain degree, as I believe all people of this country should, and the Repubican party simply failed to reach it.</p>
								<p>Recently, whenever a big political story breaks, our parties have a habit of reverting to old schoolyard methods of discourse: the classic, “But they did it so why can’t I?” If we had two equally reasonable sides to this question, then perhaps, although juvenile, it may still hold some sense. However, the reality of our current political structure just does not meet that standard.  Banning a same-sex couple from buying a wedding cake is not the same as banning violent, radicalised white-supremascist groups from coalescing on social media. And protests against police brutality, murder, and racial injustice and not the same as protests at our nation’s Capitol against a fair and democratic election. These examples represent the larger polarities between the Democratic and Republican parties, where one acts upon integrity, lawfulness, and tolerance, while the other upon injustice, corruption, and chaos. Although they are both still acting in similar fashions, the reasonings behind these events show just how far below legitimacy the Republican party has fallen, and just how conclusively they are Democrat’s unequal. If we are to truly evaluate the events of January 6th, and by extension the actions of the Republican party, we mustn’t let these false equivalencies dominate our conversations without acknowledging these distinctions.</p>
