								<p>I hate fighting. I’m not aggressive. I’m quiet and caring. I’m a woman. Does that matter? Feminist scholars have debated the validity of traditional feminine traits for years, and whether they are rooted in biological nature or societal structures - or both. Regardless of the cause, human beings have at some point created a dichotomy where men should encompass certain traits, while women should lay claim to the other, usually opposite ones. Traditional masculine traits may be defined as being assertive, stern, defiant, and in response traditional feminine traits may be defined as being understanding, caring, and docile. This gender polarity, whether valid or not, exists in our culture and manifests itself in our thoughts and actions every day. Since men and their corresponding masculine traits have been revered across decades and cultures, females and their designated characteristics have subsequently gone undervalued.</p>
								<p>Feminist have long pushed for the ability of women to move into the workforce, which they have recently accomplished in record numbers and in noticeably male dominated fields -- at least in white-collar work. Male dominated blue-collar work around the U.S. still sees very little women, but soon will be seeing very little employees in general. Reports by the Bureau of Labor statistics have recently stated that the two jobs facing the largest decline from 2014 to 2024 are locomotive firers and vehicle electronics, which are 96 percent and 98 percent male, respectively. As these jobs are lost to machines, outsourcing, or assembly shortcuts, men are left to question their masculinity not just in their ability to provide for their family, but in the fact that many of the fastest growing jobs are various types of health aids, which are reported to be about 90 percent female. Men have been reluctant to move into these jobs because they are considered “women’s work,” and are therefore paid less than male-dominated blue-collar work and require different skills, such as patient interaction and hospitality, that men feel are unattainable behind their bars of masculinity. But men have not avoided healthcare altogether. Certain jobs, such as surgical technologists, radiology technicians, and respiratory therapists, are seen as a safe zone for men to enter because they aren’t strongly associated with feminized traits that other health aid professions are. These jobs still underpay though, and have thus far continued to be dominated by women, so the only other factor that seems to be the cause of undervaluation is not the traditionally feminine traits in themselves, but the women who encompass them. With that being said, men should be wary to trivialize femininity, because they stand to lose the most by blocking themselves off from a variety of other secure and rewarding positions. By placing more value on femininity, men can help themselves in obvious yet understated ways.</p>
								<p>Men are not the only ones that can benefit from embracing traditional feminine traits. Some of women’s greatest assets stem from their allowance to act caringly, cooperatively, and understandingly. A Harvard Business Review study recently evaluated the judgement and effectiveness of leaders in 16 competencies based on 360 evaluations, the most recent including 7,280 leaders. Women were not only evaluated as better leaders in all positions, but in 15 out of the 16 competencies, women out-performed men. Most of the traits that drove women’s lead over men’s are stereotypically paired with femininity, such as “Practices Self-Development”, “Inspires and Motivates Others”, “Builds Relationships”, and “Collaboration and Teamwork.” Actions such as being caring, collaborative, and inspiring, have allowed men to classify women as the weaker sex, both physically and mentally, but in reality they prove to not just be a woman’s greatest asset, but a leader’s.</p> 
								<p>In addition to being beneficial in areas such as the job market and leadership hierarchies, conventionally female characteristics have also shown to be favorable in the field of education. An Australian study that assessed the actions of boys and girls in kindergarten found that the boys who acted in a traditionally masculine manner by play fighting, acting out, and constructing warrior narratives using the tools in the classroom got reprimanded by teachers for breaking the classroom rules. Meanwhile, the girls who acted in a traditionally feminine matter by playing and acting out more docile roles such as the mother and princess were favored by teachers for being more obedient. This trend can be followed up the educational ladder, where lower grades and less support can be given to boys who follow their gender roles. Additionally, traditional masculinity traps men in an unemotional, invulnerable shell, and as a result boys and men frequently find an outlet in dangerous activities such as drinking and drugs, which veer them off a steady academic pathway. Women who embrace the gender roles placed upon them do not face these same consequences, but instead see themselves excelling at school because of their ability to stay focused and utilize a healthier emotional outlet. Although for many years the traditional gender roles placed upon women have been associated negatively, in the sector of education, they allow women to excel in ways men are still held back from.</p>
								<p>In defense for the endorsement of traditional femininity, women who display strength and aggression mustn't be overlooked. The modern feminist movement has brought upon a wave of empowered women hungering to speak their mind, take no nonsense, and call out those who belittle them. In the most recent feminist wave, this empowerment can be seen from the women of the #MeToo movement, who have come forward loudly and aggressively about perpetrators of sexual assault. In these crusades, it seems as though women are abandoning the negatively-connotated gendered roles they have been trapped in for so long in order to gain empowerment. However, as ensnaring as gender roles are, to empower women by having them act more like men instead of placing more value on femininity only swerves around the problem instead of hitting it straight on. It may seem as if the new wave of strong women are acting in the prior form, but in the movement of speaking out, admitting one’s fear, and resisting oversexualization, women are actually redefining strength on their own terms, for their own gender. Men bound by traditional masculinity frequently feel ashamed and don’t speak out on uncomfortable matters, or dismiss feelings of negativity off the basis that men are supposed to always enjoy sexual activities, as long as they are performed by women. In this way, traditional female traits have allowed women the platform to hold accountable some very powerful men, and embrace their own power within themselves.</p>
								<p>In an ideal world, gender roles would be dismantled, and men and women would be able to act across all spectrums of identity. Maybe in the future, this concept can become reality. For now, women and men are still pressured into acting a certain way in accordance with their gender, and those who demonstrate traditionally feminine traits are wrongly undervalued and negated. Even so, in the fields of jobs, leadership, education, and social movements, traits that have been gendered as feminine have been shown to be great assets. In an effort to equalize the world, we mustn't place an obligation for women to escape what has been devalued for so long, but to place new value on traits that deserve it, to allow both men and women to thrive.</p>
