								<p>As a preteen on the verge of discovering my own style I wondered about all the different hands a piece of clothing passed through before it landed in mine. My emotions would warp into guilt as viral posts about the atrocities of sweatshop labor loomed in the back of my mind. My generation laid the groundwork for social media callouts around topics like cancel culture and political accountability and then passed the crusade down to Generation Z. But the once well-meaning movement for collective responsibility within the global garment industry was soon co-opted by corporations seeking to save face through greenwashing, scapegoating, and virtue signaling. Terms like “fast fashion” and “sweatshop” are now commonly used to denigrate mass-appeal brands while more expensive labels that tout factory transparency and sustainable materials pop up as quickly as new fashion trends.</p>
								<p>This holiday season, as young shoppers think twice about the social and environmental impacts of the products in their carts, it’s worth examining what we’re really buying into when it comes to ethical consumerism.</p>
								<p>Before I was born Jeffrey Ballinger’s <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1992/08/the-new-free-trade-heel/">exposé</a> on Nike’s sweatshop operations, published in Harper’s Magazine in 1992, accelerated the modern-day movement calling for fairer labor practices in the garment industry. Since then, progress has ebbed and flowed through increased pressure for better conditions from activist groups and governing bodies against opposing pressure for newer, cheaper, and faster products from contemporary waves of globalized consumers. Recently Gen Z has spurred up a renewed interest in sustainable, moral fashion practices. McKinsey’s 2019 <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/the-influence-of-woke-consumers-on-fashion">State of Fashion report</a> named the rise of “woke” consumers as one of their ten fashion trends to watch, finding that nine in ten Gen Z consumers “believe companies have a responsibility to address environmental and social issues.” The report noted that a “new global ethos is emerging, and billions of people are using consumption as a means to express their deeply held beliefs.” For my generation, opposing “fast fashion” is, well, fashionable. But making affordable chain brands the scapegoat for the entire global retail clothing industry won’t fix the core of what plagues the current system.</p>
						    <p>The reinvigorated appeal for moral shopping has pushed Google searches for the phrase "<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=fast%20fashion%20brands&geo=US">fast fashion brands</a>" up by 600% from 2017 to its peak in July 2020. Hashtags like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/boycottfastfashion/">#boycottfastfashion</a> have flooded Instagram with over 13,000 posts, driven by a recent influx of activism-focused accounts. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=fastfashion&t=1636935333545">Tik Tok videos</a> admonishing fast fashion brands regularly go viral and get multi-millions of views. Hard-line narratives — "<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-quit-fast-fashion-2019-3">I Quit Fast Fashion a Year Ago and Discovered 9 Reasons to Never Go Back</a>" and "<a href="https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/heres-why-you-should-never-shop-at-shein-no-matter-what-8140d285cf4b,">Here’s Why You Should Never Shop at Shein No Matter What</a>" — speak directly to young consumers who, despite their moral stances, are more likely to be allured by the low cost of fast fashion clothing. SheIn, a China-based online shop known for its constantly growing collection of affordable clothing and shady sweatshop policies has become a prime target. The hashtag <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/boycottshein">#boycottshein</a> has reached 4.5M total views on TikTok, with the shop becoming almost synonymous with “fast fashion.”</p>
                <p>Yet, the term “fast fashion” itself is hard to define and even harder to pin on the innumerable amount of brands in the retail clothing industry. Merriam Webster defines “fast fashion” as “an approach to the design, creation, and marketing of clothing fashions that emphasizes making fashion trends quickly and cheaply available to consumers.” Many correlate the term with “sweatshop labor,” which has been defined as “a shop or factory in which employees work for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions.” A Vox Media piece, "<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/3/21080364/fast-fashion-h-and-m-zara">Fast Fashion, Explained</a>" bluntly informs readers that “If you’ve bought clothes in the past decade, odds are that at least one item came from a fast fashion brand.” The phenomenon is fueled by the rise of social media, the advancement of global supply chains, and the legitimation of the “race to the bottom” socio-economic framework that champions deregulation and lower tax rates, which in turn incentivises businesses to compete in achieving the lowest costs and highest profits by employing the cheapest markets worldwide. Young consumers who oppose these unethical practices and want to use their wallets for good turn to brands that lead with ethical messaging and an overly transparent “you can trust us” aura. But while sneering at fast fashion, us young consumers may fail to scrutinize the garment industry as a whole: a sprawling, high stakes, interdependent economic system that simply can’t be pinned on a single scapegoat.</p>
                <p>The Coalition to End Forced Labour in the Uyghur Region <a href="https://enduyghurforcedlabour.org/fashion/">found</a> that “at least 1 in 5 cotton garments in the global apparel market are at risk of being tainted with Uyghur forced labour.” I don’t know about you, but I certainly have more than 5 cotton clothing items in my closet, making me an (albeit at the time unknowing) enabler of what amounts to modern-day slave labor. A <a href="https://www.workersrights.org/research-report/unfinished-business-outstanding-safety-hazards-at-garment-factories-show-that-the-accord-must-be-extended-and-expanded/">report</a> by the Worker Rights Consortium found that factories used by 12 brands who had signed the <a href="https://bangladeshaccord.org/">Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh</a> in 2013 failed to install adequate safety measurements such as fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and/or emergency exits. The Accord was created in response to the Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh that killed more than 1100 people, making it the deadliest garment-factory disaster in history. The five-year independent agreement (which was extended another 3 years in 2018) between global brands, retailers, and trade unions was in some regards successful in shedding light on failures and bringing incremental change to the industry. But the report, which was released one month before The Accord expired, found that huge global brands from H&M to PVH Corp, which owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein amongst others, failed to implement key safety components laid out in the agreement they signed. The outing of H&M in this investigation should not be surprising to anyone aware of common fast fashion brands, but Tommy Hilfigier and Calvin Klein, with their heftier price tags, would generally be spared of such a label. Even more damning is the accusation that “Every brand included in this report is fully aware of the safety deficiencies at its factories in Bangladesh and receives regular reports on these from the Accord.” If these brands, who willingly signed such an agreement, have no intention of improving their facilities, then how can we expect that other brands have or will?</p>
                <p>Exploring this question is an investigative feat, but some activist groups are trying. The organization <a href="https://remake.world/about/who-we-are/">Remake</a>, a self-proclaimed “community of fashion lovers, women rights advocates, and environmentalists on a mission to change the industry’s harmful practices on people and our planet,” created an <a href="https://directory.remake.world/#/?page=1">assessment tool</a> that rates clothing brands on a scale of 0–100 based on a rubric of factors that include transparency, labor practices, sustainability, and diversity and inclusion. They then compile the ratings in a brand directory that consumers can consult when making purchasing decisions. However, even such a well-meaning system can struggle in exposing the whole picture. When examining the ratings given to our old friend SheIn, who got a whopping <a href="https://directory.remake.world/#/item/https_www_shein_com">score of 0</a>, versus Everlane, which markets itself as a progressive, transparent brand and scored a <a href="https://directory.remake.world/#/item/https_www_everlane_com">satisfactory 45</a>, the proof is not quite conclusive. The rubric calls out SheIn’s “Very weak Code of Conduct” that touts <a href="https://eur.shein.com/campaign/csr">promises</a> like “We never. EVER. engage in child or forced labor. If any of our partners violate labor laws or fail to meet our standards, we terminate and report them immediately,” and “we only produce 50–100 pieces per new product to ensure no raw materials are wasted. Only when we confirm that a style is in high demand, do we implement large-scale production.” Everlane scored higher points under the same category even though their Code of Conduct echoed <a href="https://www.everlane.com/vendor-code">similar claims</a>: “Everlane condemns and prohibits forced labor or human rights abuses of any kind within our supply chain and only sources materials and operates in manufacturing facilities that ensure fair and humane practices,” and “Suppliers and vendors must comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations where they do business and undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility.”</p>
                <p>While these assurances sound nice, it’s hard to definitively know how accurately they translate to reality. The activist organization <a href="https://goodonyou.eco/">Good On You</a>, which has a very similar brand rating system as Remake’s, published an <a href="https://goodonyou.eco/how-ethical-everlane/">article</a> looking into Everlane’s ethical claims that found “Though publicly sharing a list of suppliers is a good step towards ‘radical transparency,’ Everlane doesn’t state whether this is a complete list of suppliers, and the list doesn’t include any suppliers at the raw material stage. What’s more, although the images provided depict good working conditions, it is difficult to confirm that they are truly representative of Everlane’s suppliers, as they were not provided (or audited) by an independent third party. It’s also unclear which part of the supply chain is audited and how often those audits occur.” To top it off, Everlane was embroiled in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/fashion/everlane-employees-ethical-clothing.html">controversy</a> last year when “former employees . . . accused the company of anti-Black behavior and union busting.”</p>
                <p>Whatever the merits of ethical brand ratings systems, virtually all the brands who scored well on Good On You, which seems to have a harsher evaluation process than Remake, are small shops with very big price tags. With that being said, all of this is not to outright accuse Everlane of being deceitful or defend fast fashion brands like SheIn, but rather to unravel the ethical practices of all fashion brands, “fast” or “slow.”</p>
                <p>Fast fashion became an easy scapegoat for a few reasons. One origin may be from when the “Made in America” ideology emerged from the economic backlash to outsourcing. A myth materialized that buying brands labelled “Made in America” absolved consumers. This idea has since been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-does-made-in-usa-actually-mean-2017-2">scrutinized</a>. Investigators found that domestic labels can be used “as long as the item was cut and sewn in the US and the fabric was created in the US, regardless of where the fiber was originated or where the yarn was spun.” This myth — American ethical, foreign unethical — is reinforced by the culturally “un-Western” packaging and online presences of products made in countries such as China, Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Another factor may be plain old PR. In the aftermath of the 1992 exposé Nike made efforts to fix their image, with one being the creation of internal systems to address labor complaints. The result has allowed those unhappy with the company’s policies to raise issues within the internal system rather than on the streets in protest. As Maria S. Eitel, who was Nike’s vice-president for corporate responsibility until 2004, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2004-09-19/online-extra-nikes-new-game-plan-for-sweatshops">puts it</a>, “You haven’t heard about us recently because we’ve had our head down doing it the hard way. Now, we have a system to deal with the labor issue, not a crisis mentality.” At least that’s what consumers are led to believe. In the same realm is the increased emphasis brands now place on ethical marketing. Many fashion companies have routed a large chunk of their resources towards marketing the idea of fair labor, transparency, and eco-friendly practices. Those with enough money and resources have been able to put up quite a front, while others are more vulnerable to consumers peering behind their curtain and calling out what they find.</p>
                <p>And call out they certainly do. The emerging spotlight on moral shopping has most prominently manifested in the wallets of consumers through the secondhand market. The online thrift store ThredUp and retail analytics firm GlobalData released a <a href="https://www.thredup.com/resale/?mkt_tok=MjExLU5KWS0xNjUAAAF_tt2t-Cbo-INnOrNXAn2Jey4Br0SIk3vt9K8FMXRe9PBJJin37PN7DTR8wkJ7HioM2WuQyEV5KYlWur2eoDAPB508kogG4AMrmZEE_AIc-aKvH6o#resale-industry">2021 Resale Report</a> that predicts the secondhand market will increase from $36 billion in 2021 to $77 billion by 2025, at a rate of about 11 times that of the broader retail clothing sector. The main drivers? My generation of shoppers.</p>
                <p>Young buyers are “drawn to thrifting for its sustainability and eclectic and cool styles.” During the pandemic, interest only increased. The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce (RSA) found in a <a href="https://www.thersa.org/reports/fashion-sustainable-recovery">survey</a> conducted during the pandemic that “Those between the ages of 18 and 24 (27 percent) are planning to support brands with strong social and environmental policies, and 35 percent of 18–24 year olds intend to buy fewer items of clothing after the lockdown has ended.” The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/may/25/shopping-habits-of-generation-z-could-spell-end-of-fast-fashion">reported</a> that the peer-to-peer reselling app Depop “has seen a 90% increase in traffic” since April 2020, driven by Gen Z shoppers. In the same month, general retail sales fell by a record 18.1%.</p>
                <p>This all points in the right direction for practical and beneficial change in the garment industry. Buying secondhand relieves some of the demand for the fast and abundantly made clothing associated with stereotypical fast fashion. But in order for such an initiative to work, buying secondhand must happen in place of retail shopping, not in addition to it, since even brands who seem above fast fashion tactics are likely complicit in the hazardous system. “Haul” content — when people show viewers what they’ve bought, usually clothing items for fashion inspiration — still ranks highly on social media. On Tik Tok, the hashtag <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/haul">#haul</a> has a whopping 13.6 billion views, that’s billion with a B, compared to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/boycottfastfashion">#boycottfastfashion</a>, which pulls in a meager 4.3 million views.</p>
                <p>Consumers must also reckon with the unintended effects of buying less, mainly the hypothesis that it may put garment workers in developing countries out of work where their current conditions are dismal yet better than the alternative. There has been ongoing debate over the validity of this claim with some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/do-sweatshops-lift-workers-out-of-poverty.html">arguing</a> based on small-scale models that “The alternatives were not so bad after all.” Still, it’s difficult to realistically predict the large-scale impacts of a mostly hypothetical situation in such an ever-interconnected and complex world.</p>
                <p>Data shows consumers are at least interested in trying. Just <a href="https://www.axios.com/uyghur-forced-labor-prevention-act-cb313edd-7f38-4f12-a788-f2482fe4db96.html?utm_campaign=organic&utm_medium=socialshare&utm_source=twitter">recently</a> the House of Representatives passed the <a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6753dc08-7217-4f24-9c27-911120f35a4e/2DFEF506AAAC84B14B6E504B6A1515DD.uflp.pdf">Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act</a>, which would “ban all imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang unless the U.S. government determines that the products were not made with forced labor.” It’s noted, however, that importing products made from forced labor is already illegal and has been hard to enforce.</p>
                <p>Consumer culture remains woven into the fabric of capitalistic societies as not just a means to spend hard-earned paychecks but also as an avenue for expression, connection, and escapism. It’s a hard sell to argue that we as a society should just buy less, yet given the circumstances it seems a measure worth considering for consumers who wish to see positive change in the garment industry. So maybe instead of action we can first start with a question: This holiday season do I really need to buy my loved-ones material items as gifts, or would they be just as or more happy with an experience, a gesture, or just an earnest declaration of appreciation?</p>
