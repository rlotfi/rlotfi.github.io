								<p>William Wohlforth writes on the topic of his article titled “Realism” in The Oxford Handbook of International Relations that “It argues that the notion that realism can and should be reduced to a single, internally consistent, and logically coherent theory is the taproot of the greatest misunderstanding” (Wohlforth 2008, 131). Through this article realism can best be understood as a theory in the field of international relations that generally encompasses four central propositions: groupism (the idea that “Politics takes place within and between groups” (Wohlforth 2008, 133) such as states), egoism (“When individuals and groups act politically, they are driven principally by narrow self‐interest. This egoism is rooted in human nature” (Wohlforth 2008, 133)), anarchy (“The absence of government” (Wohlforth 2008, 133) in the global arena), and power-politics (“Key to politics in any area is the interaction between social and material power, an interaction that unfolds in the shadow of the potential use of material power to coerce” (Wohlforth 2008, 133)). However, Wohlforth and other IR scholars argue that these four central propositions – both in relation to the thinkers who conceptualized them and to empirical examinations – lack coherency, resulting in a breakdown of unity within realism. This can be demonstrated through the many conceptual clashes between the sub schools or branches that have sprouted from the overarching theory of realism. An analysis of realisms unity (or lack thereof) can be conducted by examining the differing expectations in each of the four central propositions and the diverse realist subschools in which they appear.</p>
								<p>The idea and importance of groupism is seen in differing views within the framework of offensive and defensive realism, which are both considered branches within the school of neorealism, a reformulated extension of classical realism. Offensive realists posit that, “. . . states are often tempted to expand or otherwise strengthen themselves—and/or to weaken others—in order to survive over the long haul” (Wohlforth 2008, 139). This idea assigns significance to the realist assumption of anarchy and removes it from the individuality of the state. In contrast, defensive realists posit that, “. . . states could still be expected to find ways of defending themselves without threatening others. . .” (Wohlforth 2008, 139). This idea assigns importance and responsibility to the individual states themselves, reinforcing the realist assumption of groupism. This is just one example of how different views within the concept of groupism, a major pillar of realism, compromise the unity of the entire theory itself.</p>
								<p>In his essay “Realism: A Disarrayed Tradition” Mehmet Tabak examines the contradictions in Hans Morgenthau’s conceptualization of egoism in the theory of neorealism. Tabak writes that “The assumption here is that the social and political world is ‘but a projection of human nature. . .. ’ Because of this, his [Morgenthau’s] version of political realism has been dubbed ‘biological’ or ‘human nature realism,’ which is said to link him directly to stereotypical Machiavellianism and other classical realists” (Tabak, 7). This would tie Morgenthau’s theory of realism directly into the core proposition of egoism – after all, Machiavellianism is infamously depicted as being centered around self-interest based on human nature. However, Tabak is quick to point out Morgenthau’s contradictions: “It turns out, on many occasions, Morgenthau appears as a moralistic optimist. . . ‘Man is an animal longing for power, but he is also a creature with a moral purpose, and while man cannot be governed by abstract moral principles alone, he cannot be governed by power alone either’” (Tabak, 9). Upon revealing this misalignment, the question remains whether egoism – the drive for power rooted in self-interest – could stand as a core pillar of realism while also validating the notion of action rooted in morality.</p>
						    <p>The variations in the neorealist conceptualization of anarchy is said to be the force behind the creation of offensive and defensive realism. Wohlforth explains, “. . . although anarchy is theoretically a constant, ‘there can be significant variation in the attractiveness of cooperative or competitive means, the prospects for achieving a high level of security, and the probability of war’ (Glaser 1997, 172). The article prompted a major debate among realists that eventually ended up in the two subschools of offensive and defensive realism” (Wohlforth 2008, 142). The existence of these opposing subschools that each view anarchy through a different framework is an example of theoretical variation within one of the four central propositions of realism. This variation thus threatens the unity of realism as a whole tradition.</p>
                <p>Edward A. Kolodziej, when examining the many faces of realism, writes that “in sharp contrast to traditional realists, neorealists identify the security and survival of the state, not power per se, as the overriding, privileged aim of state action” (Kolodziej 2005, 137). This is a direct contradiction to the fourth central proposition of realism: that material power is the strongest force of coercion on the actions and relations between states. Even within neorealism, defensive realism, as described previously, allows for the idea that states do not have to continually seek power in order to survive, downplaying the prominence of power politics in inter-state relations.</p>
                <p>There is an immense amount of variable thought within realism both between classical and neorealism and within neorealism itself, which now reigns supreme in the realist tradition. As Kolodziej puts it, “This school of thought embraces a wide range of scholars who often differ, sharply and seriously, among themselves” (Kolodziej 2005, 127). As a result, realisms unity has been a hotly debated topic in the field of international relations.</p>
