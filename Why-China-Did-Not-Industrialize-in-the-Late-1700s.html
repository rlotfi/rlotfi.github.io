								<p>In the late 1700s the world found itself undergoing immense and unprecedented change both in physical innovation and in the minds of those subjected to such transformation. The Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century brought the steam engine and the cotton gin, amongst other technological feats, that pushed Europe into a new age. Left behind was the biological old regime, what Robert Marks in his book <i>The Origins of the Modern World: A Global and Environmental Narrative from the Fifteenth to the Twenty-First Century</i> defines as, “The necessities of life—food, clothing, shelter, and fuel for heating and cooking—mostly came from the land, from what could be captured from annual energy flows from the sun to Earth” (Marks 2015, 97).</p>
								<p>Such immense change, however, did not roll out evenly throughout the world, and those at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution created their own narrative to explain the uneven distribution, a narrative that still persists today. Marks explains that, “As the Industrial Revolution of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was just beginning, the classical British political economists—Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, and David Ricardo—developed another strand to be woven into the story of the rise of the West: the ideas of capitalist industrial development as ‘progress,’ the West as ‘progressive,’ and Asia (and by implication, Africa and Latin America, too) as ‘backward’ and ‘despotic.’ (Marks 2015, 3). Yet he further contends that China had equal if not more opportunity than England to advance into their own Industrial Revolution in the 1700s. So why didn’t they?</p>
								<p>The story of China’s stunted industrialization in the 1700s may have actually started a few centuries earlier. In the 1400s China had a formidable presence in the seas, where “ . . . Chinese ships sailed as far as Mozambique on the east coast of Africa, into the Persian Gulf, all around the Indian Ocean, and throughout the Spice Islands of Southeast Asia” (Marks 2015, 43). By 1435, their presence was so powerful and extensive that Marks declares such sea routes, “ . . . [placed] much of the oceangoing trade in the world under Chinese eyes, if not control” (Marks 44). Yet that power began to decline when China pulled many of its vessels out of the water and abandoned the seas for the more pressing matters of population growth, agriculture availability, and Mongol aggression. By the 1500s no Chinese vessels remained in the Indian Ocean and the Chinese navy ceased to exist offshore. Without this voluntary concession of the seas it is likely that China would have maintained its dominance and utilized overseas routes to foster massive trade opportunities and accumulate resources that would have led to wealth and industrialization, as Europe did. This would be the beginning of various instances where the actions of both China and the European state’s governing bodies either strayed away from opportunities to industrialize or charged towards them.</p>
							  <p>Another instance was in the way China and Eruope ran their respective markets in the 1700s. Debunked is the idea that China’s market was less developed or efficient than England’s – in fact, Marks argues that in some ways it was perhaps better. However, a few specific policies hindered China from stepping into their own Industrial Revolution. The first occurred when Chinese peasants migrated to peripheral lands  but without oversight from a market authority. Left to their own devices they decided it was easier to “ . . . spin and weave their own cotton textiles for their own use and for local exchange, rather than concentrating on rice or raw cotton and importing the finished goods” (Marks 2015, 109). Thus, populations located in rural China effectively excused themselves from the larger market and the amount of raw cotton sold to the textile-producing centers decreased. At the same time, the area the local populations were using to grow their own cotton was inhibited from being used to grow rice, so the amount of rice exported decreased as well. On the other hand, the European states utilized imperialism and  heavy governmental support towards private industries to push for wider markets and profits. In the biological old regime, land – more importantly, quality land – was the main limiting resource, and imperialism allowed states to increase their land availability, resource diversity, and trade opportunities.</p>
                <p>The European governments also heavily supported private trading companies such as the English East India Company (EIC) and the Dutch Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC, East India Company), which Marks describes were “ . . . chartered by their governments and given monopoly rights to trade with Asia, all in keeping with mercantilist ideas” (Marks 2015, 100). The combination of imperialism and private industry, both backed by European governments, allowed those states to garner the profits and resources needed to bring about their industrialization. This was exemplified when England, threatened by India’s successful textile industry, implemented policies to topple India’s competitive advantage by “ . . . raising tariffs on imports to Britain of Indian textiles, and the outright banning of the importation of some kinds of Indian cotton goods” (Marks 100), something Marks calls, “mercantilist protectionism” (Marks 100). As Burbank and Cooper in their book <i>Empires in World History: Power and the Politics of Difference</i> explain, “The company mode of empire – with government charters defining monopolies and legitimizing private exercise of governmental functions but with capital markets footing much of the bill – was used by the British in other parts of the world” (Burbank and Cooper 2010, 173). In contrast, China’s focus was on domestic land and labor, essentially trapping it in the biological old regime. As Marks sums it up, “The English proved willing and able to use state power for economic ends” (Marks 92). China, more concerned with other domestic issues, seemed not as much. The complexity of how Europe utilized imperialism and capitalism to give them an advantage in industrialization is summed up by Burbank and Cooper: “It was the complementarity between metropolitan and imperial resources that pushed Britain’s economy ahead. Sugar was grown in the Caribbean; labor came from Africa. Feeding workers in England was not therefore constrained by the limits of land and labor at home. Combined with tea, another imperial product, sugar did much to keep workers in the cotton mills for long hours—without devoting British resources to the potatoes, grain, or sugar beets that would have been alternative sources of calories” (Burbank and Cooper 236).</p>
                <p>Another factor as to why China did not industrialize in the 1700s was due to environmental limitations. By the early 1800’s, the European powers were in some ways serendipitously in a favorable position for industrialization because of their geography. Marks describes how “ . . . Europeans had colonies that supplied them with huge amounts of ‘free’ energy (sugar, cotton, timber, codfish), and in the case of the British in particular, the good fortune to have coal deposits lying close to the surface and to the centers of population and manufacturing that needed new sources of energy when their forests were used up” (Marks 2015, 129). Indeed it was a stroke of geographical luck that European land was over such large coal deposits and that environmental conditions pushed the English to turn to coal in order to heat their homes. In contrast, China’s vastly greater population (about 400 million in 1800 compared to England’s 25 million) would have made it hard to accomplish similar standards. But more importantly is how, as Marks explains, “Coal was essential for London, and the British state put in place policies that encouraged the production and transport of coal to London, and then to Lancashire” (Marks 116). China did not have as active of an interest in coal, leaving it behind as England eventually utilized the resource to fuel steam-powered machines.</p>
                <p>Additionally, China’s demand for silver from 1500 to 1800 set the groundwork for Europe’s economy and worldwide trade markets. As Marks puts it, “Without China’s demand for silver, it seems fair to say, the European role in the world economy would have been greatly diminished” (Marks 2015, 131). All told, ‘‘approximately three-quarters of the New World silver production’’ over three centuries eventually wound up in China. The reason is that China had a huge demand for silver, both to serve as the basis of its monetary system and to facilitate economic growth. But the flow of silver from the Americas to China would not have been possible without the mines located in Potosí on the Bolivian Altiplano. And without Potosí’s silver opening up such a thriving trade opportunity, Marks argues, “ . . . the Spanish would not have attempted to create an empire in Europe” (Marks 81). And, as mentioned earlier, imperialism was indeed a factor that allowed Europe to industrialize when China did not.</p>
                <p>The last factor as to why China did not industrialize in the 1700s was because of cultural limitations. There resided a cultural convention where women did the weaving, and weaving occurred inside the household. This closed off the women and girls of many Chinese families from participating in the market. On the contrasting side, the respective freedom of peasant farmers in China hindered the rapid growth of their textile industry compared to the vigorous work demanded from slaves and serfs in the European system. In terms of reproductive customs, the myth that the Chinese weren’t capable of population control is aptly debunked by Marks. On the contrary, the Chinese were so agriculturally efficient that their population still grew despite other reproductive constraints. However, populations migrated across their vast land and as a result, land available for agriculture decreased. As Marks puts it, “ . . . the four necessities of life—food, clothing, shelter, and fuel—all came from the land and hence were in competition” (Marks 2015, 107). This relates back to the notion that China was nearing its peak in the biological old regime but was unable to progress past it because it did not possess vast imperial lands and subjugated laborers as Europe did in the 1700s.</p>
                <p>One could even argue that the demand for opium in China during this time was also a cultural factor that helped Europe industrialize while China did not. With the massive influx of opium into the country, the people of China became dependent on an addictive drug, fueling an economy that now imported opium and exported silver that went into the pockets of industrialists in England and the US. Marks explains that “ . . . while the Chinese bore some responsibility for bringing the drug plague on themselves, British guns had forced open the door in the first place” (Marks 2015, 132). China being unable to defend themselves from the guns or the addictive nature of opium combined with the trade profits flowing into the West created once again a scenario where industrialization emerged in Europe but was hampered in China.</p>
                <p>The eurocentric idea that China was simply less developed and efficient than England and thus did not experience the same industrial revolution is simply false. More importantly, it overshadows the real reasons for why industrialization did not occur in China during the 1700s: lack of imperialistic and capitalistic governmental policies, seemingly unlucky environment conditions, and cultural factors. China was indeed on the right track to experience an industrial boom in the late 1700s – Marks notes that “In 1775, Asia produced about 80 percent of everything in the world” (Marks 2015, 82), – but the interconnected world system that fostered Europe’s Industrial Revolution was not only absent in China but oftentimes furthered progress at the expense of another state’s. By analyzing the causes of industrialization in Europe we can shed light on the causes of non-industrialization in China.</p>
