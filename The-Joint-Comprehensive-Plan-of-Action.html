								<p>In both books <i>Losing the Long Game: The False Promise of Regime Change in the Middle East</i> by Philip H. Gordon and <i>The Back Channel: American Diplomacy in a Disordered World</i> by William J. Burns, US foreign policy towards the Middle East is described using the same phrase: the long game. Gordon, a former Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and current National Security Advisor to Vice President Kamala Harris, argues that continual failures of US foreign policy over multiple administrations is the reason for the region's current instability. Burns, a former United States Deputy Secretary of State under President Obama and current Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, uses the term to describe Obama’s strategy to deal with the ever-evolving world he inherited as president: “That required playing a long game—molding an emerging international order, realigning relationships with major powers like China, India, and Russia, and revitalizing diplomacy to achieve goals like preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons” (Burns 2021, 245). The latter would eventually come to fruition as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran Nuclear Deal, and is seen as one of Obama’s greatest accomplishments in foreign policy. But the process to get there was indeed a long game, both grueling and oftentimes seeming hopeless. Even so, it was a remarkable example of diplomacy being used to reach a mutually beneficial agreement between states, a tool that is unfortunately often overlooked.</p>
								<p>The story of the JCPOA’s inception, although seen as a landmark foriegn policy agreement under President Barack Obama, began under the administration of his predecessor President George W. Bush. This may seem surprising since the two presidents’ viewpoints on foreing policy were virtually opposite, with Bush adopting a hard-lined, military interventionist approach, and Obama championing a non-interventionist diplomatic strategy. But both presidents recognized the need to put a check on Iran and by extension the Middle East lest the region's instability and hostility reach levels of substantial destruction.</p>
								<p>During President Bush’s first presidential term in 2001, US intelligence unearthed the existence of two well-hidden nuclear sites – undeclared to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) – in the Iranian cities of Natanz and Arak. The former was a uranium enrichment plant and the latter reportedly had the capabilities to eventually produce weapons grade plutonium. These establishments were ostensibly formed as part of Iran’s civilian nuclear energy program, but they worried US officials. According to Burns, whose book is based on first-hand accounts of his experience as a primary negotiator for the JCPOA, “The revelation of the covert sites in the summer of 2002 set off a diplomatic dance that continued for the next several years. The UN Security Council passed resolutions demanding that Iran suspend its enrichment work. Iran instead plowed stubbornly ahead” (Burns 2021, 339). The Bush administration refused to give credence to the Iranian regime by negotiating directly with them, so at this time the EU-3 (the United Kingdom, France, and Germany) headed talks. This group would eventually be known as the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany). However, unsurprisingly, these talks wouldn’t produce much of a resolution, and at the end of Bush’s administration in 2008, “ . . . despite the imposition of several rounds of UN sanctions against Iran and growing international concern, the Iranians had accumulated half the amount of lowenriched uranium they would need to enrich further and make a single bomb” (Burns 339).</p>
							  <p>It should be noted that during this time American intelligence concluded that Iran had already suspended its weapons work since 2003, but “ . . . the fact that they were clearly determined to keep their options open in the face of mounting international pressure was deeply troubling” (Burns 2021, 339). It was clear that matters pertaining to nuclear weaponry could not be taken lightly or even faithfully, and especially so given the rocky relations between the US, our allies including Israel, and the Middle East.</p>
                <p>Throughout the later years of Bush’s presidency, and after coming under fire for the debacle that was the Iraq War, diplomacy began to look more considerable. Burns, then the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs under Bush and then Obama, pushed for the US to finally join its allies at the negotiating table. In June 2008 in Tehran, Javier Solana, the de facto European Union foreign minister, proposed a renewed P5+1 agreement with Iran that would put a freeze on “ . . . Iranian nuclear activities, including enrichment, and a reciprocal freeze on new UN Security Council sanctions, which would allow space for negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear deal” (Burns 2021, 343). Then, on July 19th in Geneva, Burns “ . . . broke the taboo on direct American participation in the nuclear talks” (Burns 343). Although it seemed like the first steps were being taken towards forming a deal with the Iranians, an agreement on both sides was far from being reached. The Iranians' response was trite and contained little substance. Nonetheless, the US felt that they had already broken substantial ground given the circumstances. Thus, as Bush’s last term came to an end, the initiative with Iran trudged on.</p>
                <p>When President Barack Obama assumed office he and his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton “ . . . moved quickly to win an increase in the international affairs budget, and issued a presidential directive emphasizing development as a core element of American foreign policy” (Burns 2021, 250). Indeed, Obama’s foreign policy promoted development but strictly opposed regime change. As Gordon puts it, the new president “ . . . expressed admiration for the foreign policies of the first president Bush – a champion of regional stability and order – while harshly criticizing those of the second, who after 9/11 put democracy promotion front and center” (Gordon 2020, 146). This policy would prove tricky to navigate in a region trife with unpredictability and eager to act aggressively against a perceived enemy who had previously wronged them. To complicate matters, the start of the 21st century introduced an “ . . . era of instantaneous news cycles; always operating with incomplete information, despite the unceasing waves of open-source and classified intelligence washing over us; often trying to choose between bad and worse options” (Burns 252). All in all, the odds were not in favor of a joint comprehensive agreement between the US and Iran, but such high stakes catalyzed both sides to keep at it.</p>
                <p>For Obama, an agreement with Iran would be the litmus test for his foreign policy doctrine of utilizing diplomacy, along with economic and military leverage, to produce results and curb adversaries. One of his first public initiatives of this doctrine with Iran was in March 2009 when, during a video recording at the White House, the president extended best wishes to those celebrating Nowruz around the world and spoke “ . . . directly to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran . . . We have serious differences that have grown over time. My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us, and to pursuing constructive ties among the United States, Iran and the international community. This process will not be advanced by threats. We seek instead engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect” (Obama 2009). This address broke precedence by calling Iran by its formal name and showcased a new tone for an American president. In May, Obama sent a secret letter to Ayatollah Khamenei that would reiterate this tone and message. As Burns summates, “He was direct about his unwavering determination to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and his support for the P5+1 position that Iran was entitled to a peaceful civilian nuclear program. He also made clear that it was not the policy of his administration to pursue regime change, and indicated his readiness for direct dialogue” (Burns 2021, 348). Khamenei’s response wasn’t necessarily welcoming, but Burns and his colleagues at the time took it as a “ . . . serious indication of his willingness to engage” (Burns 348). Now came the need for a discreet bilateral channel for the two countries to continue talks. But before that, as international affairs go, the Iranian presidential elections and its ensuing violence shook relations once again.</p>
                <p>To further complicate matters, in September 2009 US, British, and French intelligence “ . . . uncovered damning evidence of a covert Iranian enrichment site, buried deep inside a mountain near Qom. What made the clandestine site especially alarming was its relatively modest scale . . . it was much too small to produce enriched uranium fuel for a civilian nuclear power plant, but big enough to produce material for one or two nuclear bombs a year” (Burns 2021, 350). Although unnerving, this revelation gave the P5+1 concrete leverage against Iran, and they utilized that when the group met with Saeed Jalili, Iran’s nuclear negotiator, in Geneva. Burns recounts how he took the initiative to talk with Jalili privately, and as he puts it, “ . . . began the highest-level conversation between the United States and Iran since 1979” (Burns 351), and the “ . . . first bilateral talk we had ever had with the Iranians on the nuclear issue” (Burns 352).</p>
                <p>Jalili seemed open to talks but the US delegation would soon see their pessimism justified when the Iranians continuously came back to the table with new retractions, additional concessions, and relentless nitpicking. Iran’s rejection of the deal led the UN Security Council to pass Resolution 1929 in June 2010 that included much tougher additional sanctions and new EU measures that crippled Iran’s economy. However, according to Burns, “Iranian nuclear advances . . . continued to move at a dangerous pace” (Burns 2021, 354). A deal between both countries seemed at an impasse.</p>
                <p>At this point the country of Oman, under Sultan Qaboos, entered the playing field with the intention of being an intermediary and to quell any potential for conflict outside their door. They proposed the establishment of a channel to Iran through Oman, with Salem Ismaily being the principal messenger for the sultan. Ismaily suggested a direct meeting between the US and Iran in the Omani capital of Muscat. Over the next few months and into Obama’s second term progress was slow and abstract, yet Iranian negotiations remained a priority. The president outlined his main points: the direct channel would complement the wider P5+1 channel, and it would have to be kept secret to prevent domestic and allied pressures on both sides from interfering. The last point stressed the importance of focusing the backchannel talks on the nuclear issue.</p>
                <p>Burns recounts the framework of these talks, which asked Iran to “ . . . take concrete, substantial measures to give the rest of us confidence that a peaceful program could not be converted into a weapons program. If Iran were ready to do that . . . we would be willing to explore whether and how a domestic enrichment program could be pursued in Iran, as part of a comprehensive settlement of the nuclear issue. That settlement would require many difficult, long-term Iranian commitments, and intense verification and monitoring provisions. Should we eventually reach a satisfactory agreement, the United States would be prepared to call for an end to all United Nations and unilateral sanctions against the Iranian nuclear program” (Burns 2021, 364). Again, the Iranian response was far from welcoming, and at some point it looked like the talks were merely going in circles. Another shake-up was needed, and that came in the form of Hassan Rouhani’s election as Iran’s new president in June 2013. Rouhani “ . . . managed to persuade the Supreme Leader that Iran needed to explore a more serious nuclear negotiation and consider some real compromises, or face a resurgence of the internal political unrest that had jarred the regime in the summer of 2009” (Burns 368). Two days after his inauguration the president publicly announced his readiness to resume the P5+1 talks with two new deputy foreign ministers, Majid Takht-Ravanchi and Abbas Araghchi. Burns recalls that, “From the start, the atmosphere in the September round was much different, and more encouraging, than what we had experienced in March” (Burns 371). Perhaps a deal was on the horizon.</p>
                <p>In the span of a few months at the end of 2013 a few advancements were made: Obama’s second-term Secretary of State John Kerry met with Iran’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Obama had a direct phone call with Rouhani, and the secret back channel was revealed to the P5+1 delegation. In November Burns sensed “. . . that the Iranians were in a hurry to finish the deal, before their own politics became an even bigger impediment” (Burns 2021, 380). Early in the morning of ​​November 24, the plan was finalized.</p>
                <p>The Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) was a temporary but necessary step towards a more comprehensive deal. Iran would freeze its nuclear program for an initial six months and allow outside monitoring, and in return would receive limited sanctions relief and a commitment that sanctions would not increase for six months. The next step was to negotiate a comprehensive nuclear agreement, and Secretary Kerry worked diligently with Zarif to establish one.</p>
                <p>On April 2, 2014 a framework for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was announced, and in July the final deal was set. According to the official White House communication outlining the deal, it would “[Cut] off all of Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weapon, including a covert pathway, [put] in place vigorous, intrusive, and unprecedented transparency measures that are necessary to verify that Iran cannot pursue a weapon, [and ensure] sanctions can be snapped back into place if Iran violates the deal” (The Iran Nuclear Deal: What You Need To Know About The JCPOA). President Obama released a statement calling the deal a demonstration that “ . . . American diplomacy can bring about real and meaningful change” (Obama 2015). Burns deservedly pats himself on the back: “We had achieved our objective, and we diverted a potential path to war” (Burns 2021, 383). Given the circumstances, the fact that the US and Iran reached a mutual agreement on such a high-stakes matter was indeed a success in foreign policy. But it did not come out of nowhere.</p>
                <p>There were many reasons for why this deal came to fruition, and all of them needed to align somewhat serendipitously in order for it to succeed. The first was the persistence of the Obama administration to utilize diplomacy even when it felt hopeless. The continued talks over many months in many different forms allowed each side to evaluate their non-negotiables, and thus, their negotiables. Also, by simply being open to the idea of talks, both the US and Iran proved their mutual commitment, albeit sometimes wavering, to an agreement.</p>
                <p>Other factors such as the US’s intense leverage of sanctions and incriminating intelligence, along with an international consensus to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons, also played a part. But there was one factor that was the least expected: the comparative willingness of Iran to compromise at all. Diplomacy in essence requires more than one actor, and the ability for all those involved to cooperate can usually make or break a deal. Iran was a decades-long adversary who’s history with the US was tinged with bloodshed and sowed intense bitterness within the country and its government. The US negotiators were right to have deep doubts about whether their deal would succeed. And to be fair, credit is aptly due to the Americans who exercised a great deal of patience, planning, and strategizing in their talks with the Iranians. But in this situation the Iranians were the ones who needed convincing despite US leverage. Although they had much to gain in this agreement it would not have been surprising if the talks never went anywhere, or if Iran simply refused to compromise and found another way to deal with their crippling economy. The fact that they eventually agreed to the deal was monumental, and President Rouhani’s comparative openness may have been the biggest reason why this initiative was successful and not many others in Iran and the Middle East. That may not be the answer many individualists want to hear, who would prefer to impose their way on Iran either militarily or through covert action. But the JCPOA exemplifies how diplomacy between countries – even historical adversaries – is possible if the previously outlined conditions are met, and can likely side-step armed conflict, costly operations, and further strife.</p>
                <p>In the first few years of the JCPOA the IAEA and US intelligence affirmed Iranian compliance to their end of the deal. But, as Burns explains, “Iran continued to export instability across the Middle East, exploiting and accelerating chaos in Syria and Yemen, its forces and proxies locked in a bitter regional competition with Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab states” (Burns 2021, 385). Nuclear weapons were now out of their reach, but US–Iranian relations were still far from rosy. Perhaps that’s why it was easy for Obama’s successor, President Donald Trump, to show “ . . . visceral contempt for the JCPOA, which he called ‘the worst deal ever’” (Burns 385). Trump’s foreign policy was categorized as unilateral and populist, a steep departure from Obama’s multilateral diplomacy. As a result, despite no evidence of Iranian noncompliance, Trump pulled the US out of the JCPOA in May 2018.</p>
                <p>Trump’s action was seen negatively by many, including Burns. As he puts it, “Pulling out of the nuclear deal alienated allies who had joined us in the effort for many years” (Burns 2021, 386), and “ . . . was a further blow to our own credibility, to international confidence that we could keep our end of a bargain” (Burns 387). Given the rarity of the deal being made in the first place and the loss of US trust, it’s unknown if such an agreement with Iran will be reached again. With that being said, hopefully the limited but historic success of the JCPOA will be an indication that it is at least worth the effort.</p>
